Vampirism
=========

Vampires are fast, strong and blood-thirsty entities, which do not like the sun, but don't fear the night, and the best thing is: You can become one!

This mod adds several rituals which allow you to first become a vampire and then level up as a vampire, with higher levels you will get faster, stronger, better night vision etc, but it brings disadvantages with it, you take sun damage or are hunted by vampire hunters.

As a vampire you don't need to eat all that dry bread or eat these strange fruits called "apples", you prefer some red and tasty blood, which you have to suck from animals or better villagers, but be careful not every animal likes to give blood.
